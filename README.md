## 3. How can you gauge the existing knowledge of your audience to avoid overwhelming them with jargon?
Surveys & Feedback: Ask users about their familiarity with a topic.
Analyzing User Questions: FAQs and common support queries indicate knowledge gaps.
Interactive Content: Use quizzes or progress indicators to adapt explanations based on prior knowledge

## 4. What techniques can you use to ensure your content is accessible to those with limited technical knowledge?
Use everyday language: Avoid overly technical terms unless necessary.
Define jargon: Introduce new terms with explanations or examples.
Break down information: Present concepts in small, digestible sections.

## 5. Why is it important to use plain language instead of technical jargon in your writing?

for the workflow --> Flow Charts
For Data Trends --> Graphs and Charts
relationships between components --> Diagrams
Step - by - step guides --> using screen shots and GIFs
